/*
Approach:

    Similar to all the recursion problems weâ€™ve seen before, we need a base case in this problem too in order for recursion to not go infinitely. Here, we notice that the Fibonacci series start from N = 1, where we initialize its value as 1. 
    Assume Fibonacci(0) = 0. So, Fibonacci(2) = 1+0 = 1 as the Nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
    Similarly, we call Fibonacci(N-1) and Fibonacci(N-2) and return their sum. Both the function calls Fibonacci(N-1) and Fibonacci(N-2) would be computed individually one by one until the base condition is reached for both and then they return back to the main function.
